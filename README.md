Project Description :
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) project is designed to enhance the capabilities of information retrieval 
and natural language understanding by integrating document processing, vector embeddings, and generative AI. 
The project utilizes a combination of technologies, 
including the Google Gemini API for generative AI and Pinecone for vector database management.
At its core, the project begins by loading a PDF document, which is then processed using the PDFLoader from the 
Langchain library. The document is split into manageable chunks using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, 
allowing for efficient handling of large texts. 
Each chunk is transformed into vector embeddings using the Google Generative AI Embeddings model, 
which facilitates semantic search capabilities.
The processed data is stored in a Pinecone index, enabling quick retrieval of relevant information based on user queries. 
The Pinecone database is configured to handle high concurrency, ensuring that multiple queries can be processed 
simultaneously without performance degradation.
The querying mechanism is powered by a sophisticated AI model that rewrites user questions into standalone queries, 
enhancing the clarity and context of the requests. The system retrieves the top relevant documents from Pinecone 
based on the vector representation of the userâ€™s question. The retrieved context is then fed into the generative AI model, 
which produces concise and informative responses tailored to the user's inquiries.
The project features a user-friendly interface that allows users to interactively ask questions and receive answers 
based on the content of the indexed documents. By leveraging the strengths of both retrieval and generation, 
the RAG project aims to provide accurate, context-aware responses, making it a valuable tool for users 
seeking information on complex topics such as data structures and algorithms. Overall, this project 
exemplifies the potential of combining advanced AI techniques with efficient data management to enhance user 
experience and knowledge acquisition.
